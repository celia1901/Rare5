        <h2><strong>Objectives</strong></h2>
        <p>SuperLife is one of the main life insurance carriers in the country of Lumaria. In the last 23 years, SuperLife has sold two life insurance products: single-premium whole life insurance (SPWL) and 20-year term life insurance (T20). The company is looking to build a health incentive program that aims to achieve its objectives of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incentivising healthy behaviors through active participation in the program</li>
            <li>Decreasing expected mortality</li>
            <li>Increasing life insurance sales</li>
            <li>Improving product marketability and competitiveness</li>
            <li>Adding economic value to the company</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this report, Rare5 Consulting has proposed a health incentive program that consists of three main phases: Gamifying Health, a Smokers Cessation Program, and Holistic Prevention and Educational Programs. Through the implementation of the programs, Rare5 Consulting is confident that SuperLife will achieve all five objectives.</p>

        <h2><strong>Program Design</strong></h2>
        <p>As mentioned previously, the program will consist of three pillars: Gamifying Health, a Smokers Cessation Program, and Holistic Prevention and Educational Programs.</p>

        <h3>Gamifying Health</h3>
        <p>The first part of our proposed health incentive program is to Gamify Health. This consists of creating a points-based incentives program that allows individuals to receive cash at the end of the calendar year if they achieve enough points. The points will be gained if individuals participate in healthy behaviours every day including sleeping seven hours, being outside during daylight hours for over 180 minutes, or achieving 10,000 steps. To ensure individuals are actively participating in healthy behaviours, the number of points rewarded for each activity will depend on the time commitment. For example, the points associated with spending 3 hours outside during the day will be higher than the points for achieving 10,000 steps. As a way of encouraging the development of positive habits, bonus points will be awarded to policyholders who continue to achieve over 90% of their daily goals for an extended duration (up to 50 years after the first goal was achieved). A breakdown of how points will be rewarded can be found in Appendix A.1. The goals that individuals are required to reach are also designed to ensure trackability; the harder it is to track, the less points associated to the goal. 
A new customer-centric app will provide a colourfulcolorful and captivating overview of their own health. Front and center on the dashboard we will display three rings for the three daily goals so that policyholders can track their progress towards living a healthier life each day in real time (outer ring - sun, middle ring - walk, inner ring - sleep). Moreover, as part of the app the user can opt-in to receiving notifications in the form of gentle reminders when they are getting close to meeting their goals or positive messages of encouragement when there is a significant deterioration. Leveraging sophisticated machine learning algorithms, users will be able to view data trends in the palm of their hands and discover new strategies on how to keep improving. We believe the app will assist customers to become more active whilst improving their sleep quality. 
The program will be available to all participants. Research finds by gamifying health, it incentivizes individuals to participate in easy healthy behaviours that can significantly improve their wellbeing (Mitesh,Mitest et al., 2019). The approach is also marketable and makes the life insurance products sold by SuperLife more attractive compared to other insurance programs. By rewarding healthy behaviours, policyholders would not only be more engaged with their life insurance policy, but also find value in the short-term rewards making them less likely to lapse on their policy. This will improve SuperLife’s ability to retain its customers whilst also improving mortality.  </p>

        <h3>Smokers Cessation Program</h3>
        <p>The smoker’s cessation program will be centered around helping smokers to stop smoking permanently. Through analysing SuperLife’s policyholder experience, we haveRare5 Consulting has found that whilst only 6.3% of SuperLife’s customers are smokers, 35.4% of all deaths recorded were due to smoking. Besides being a main contributor to population mortality, smoking also has follow on effects, and can contribute to other diseases that would also eventually increase mortality (Qin, 2020). Circulatory System Diseases are higher correlated to smokers (Gallucci, et al., 2020) and is also the second highest cause of death of SuperLife’s policyholders. Therefore, by implementing a smoker’s cessation program, the expected mortality for smokers is likely to greatly decrease.  
It has been proven that subsidising smoking cessation treatment increases the chances of successful long-term abstinence, and that full-coverage intervention do not offer any significant benefits for quitting rates compared to partial-coverage (van den Brand, et al.,, 2017). Therefore, SuperLife will partially subsidise its policyholder’s treatments. The program outline as well coverage cost detail is explained in Appendix A.2. Individuals that require additional support outside the program will need to be paid out-of-pocket, however, the cessation program will ensure individuals are provided guidance on how to find additional resources.</p>

        <h3>Holistic Prevention and Educational Programs</h3>
        <p>The last aspect of the health program we propose is focusing on health prevention. One of the most effective ways to treat majority of diseases and ensuring longevity in an individual's health, on average, is concentrating on preventative measures.  
Within the provided in-force dataset, the top five causes of death were: 
Neoplasms (Tumours/Cancer): 33% of all deaths  
Circulatory System Diseases: 30% of all deaths  
External Reasons (etc. public accidents, intentional self-harm): 8.8% of all deaths 
Respiratory System Diseases: 6.7% of all deaths 
Digestive System Diseases: 4.6% of all deaths  
Therefore, to help reduce mortality of existing policyholders, we haveRare5 Consulting has considered fourthree main prevention and educational programs which directly aim to target the top 5 causes of deaths. These are: 
Cancer Prevention Initiative. As shown above, neoplasms (i.e. cancer/tumors) were the highest cause of death amongst policyholders. By educating individuals on this topic, we aim to reduce the number of deaths relating to cancer.  
Educational Workshops. Learning how to live a healthy lifestyleHealthy Eating Campaigns. Eating healthy is a common preventative measure that many health professionals recommend, noting it helps reduce the chance of developing diseases in the future. This may include encouraging healthy eating habits and doing exercise. 
Safety Campaigns: This campaign aims to target the third highest cause of death for policyholders, which was noted to be accidents.  
Annual Health Checkups: This campaign intends to allow policyholders to discover any diseases in the early stage, such that treatment can be arranged adequately. 
The program will involve campaigns in the form of workshops, reminder emails and company campaigns. In the case of workshops, these will be advertised first to policyholders but is also open to the public. If non-policyholders are interested, they will need to provide their contactpersonal details. Therefore, the program will not only reduce the expected mortality of policyholders but will also have reputational benefits allowing SuperLife to gain exposure and attract new customers.   </p>
